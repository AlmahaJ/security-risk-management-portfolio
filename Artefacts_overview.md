# Artefacts Overview

Below  short written artefacts  and summary (notes) of what i did in this course

I separated threat, vulnerability, likelihood, and impact. I wrote small examples for each.


I applied STRIDE to a login flow: spoofing (weak IDs), tampering (weak input checks), and information disclosure (no TLS).


I scored a basic web risk (SQL injection) with DREAD to see which items rank highest.


I wrote an attack path for “steal customer list” with multiple branches (phish staff, guess weak password, misuse USB).


I summarised why cardholder data needs network segmentation, strong controls, and logging.


See: [Unit6_RiskIdentification.md](Unit6_RiskIdentification.md)


I made owners, actions, due dates, and review dates for top risks.


I listed: prepare, conduct assessment, communicate, maintain. I linked these to our case.


I defined RTO and RPO for key services and mapped them to tests.


I wrote how resilience and quick restore match our DR design.
