# Comparison: Unit 6 vs Unit 11

## What changed
**Unit 6** used OCTAVE. It was qualitative and practical. We found basic risks (shared Wi-Fi, spreadsheets, single device, phishing) and gave quick fixes.  
**Unit 11** moved to ISO 31000 and NIST. It added numbers and clear DR design. We built simple 12-month probabilities for quality and supply chain, and we set RTO and RPO.

## Why it is better in Unit 11
1. **From lists to numbers**  
   Unit 6 said “what” and “how to fix.” Unit 11 also asked “how likely” and “by how much.” Leaders can compare trade-offs.

2. **From one device to whole business**  
   Unit 6 focused on local points. Unit 11 covered online shop, ERP, suppliers, and warehouses.

3. **From backup idea to tested DR**  
   Unit 6 mentioned backup. Unit 11 delivered a tested two-region plan with a target under one minute failover and under one minute data loss window.

## Personal growth
At first I mixed up risk analysis, assessment, and management. By Unit 11 I could explain them simply:  
- Risk analysis: find threats and weaknesses.  
- Risk assessment: measure likelihood and impact.  
- Risk management: choose and track controls.

## Result
Unit 6 gave a strong base for a small business. Unit 11 delivered a decision-ready plan with resilience, GDPR Article 32 alignment, and clear actions.
