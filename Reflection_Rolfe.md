# Reflection (Rolfe 2001) – 1,000 words

## WHAT
This module joined security and risk into one way of thinking. It showed me that risk is not only hacking. Risk also comes from how people work, how data is stored, how suppliers behave, and how change is done. I learned that security work must connect to law and trust, not only to tools. The two main artefacts in this portfolio are from Unit 6 and Unit 11. Both use clear methods and link to real business needs.

In Unit 6, my team used OCTAVE for a small business called Pampered Pets. We looked for key assets, main threats, and weak points. We saw four simple but serious risks: shared Wi-Fi for staff and business, warehouse spreadsheets on one old PC, one front-desk machine that runs sales and tax, and orders by email that invite phishing. We proposed low-cost actions that a small owner can start in weeks. This felt practical. It moved me from abstract reading to real action.

In Unit 11, the scope grew. The business wanted an online shop, an ERP system, new suppliers, and automated warehouses. VIP clients asked for strong quality and high uptime. We used ISO 31000 for the process and NIST SP 800-30 for steps. We added NIST SP 800-34 for disaster recovery tests. We built a simple 12-month probability view for quality risks and supply risks. We then designed a two-region cloud setup. It can switch in under one minute and keep the data loss window under one minute. This design meets GDPR Article 32 on resilience and restore.

My role was a normal team member. I helped search sources, drafted parts of the risk tables, and edited the text. I tried to keep sentences short and clear so non-technical readers could follow. I matched our plan with legal and business needs, especially GDPR Article 32. I also took part in reviews and accepted changes. This team rhythm helped me build trust and speed.

At the start, I felt that all frameworks looked the same. I mixed up risk analysis, risk assessment, and risk management. I was not sure when to use qualitative thinking and when to try numbers. Over time, the steps became clear. First, you find threats and weak points (analysis). Next, you estimate likelihood and impact (assessment). After that, you choose controls, test them, and track them over time (management). This simple flow reduced my confusion. It gave me a map I can reuse.

## SO WHAT
This change matters because it turns a large topic into a small set of habits. I now see when a qualitative pass is enough and when some numbers add value. For a small business with few resources, a clean qualitative pass can drive fast wins. For digital growth and VIP clients, adding basic probabilities and DR targets makes the plan stronger. It also helps leaders judge cost and benefit.

I saw how security links to law and trust. GDPR Article 32 asks for security of processing, resilience, and fast restore. Our two-region design is not only a technical choice. It shows duty of care. It proves that the company plans for failure and for recovery. This builds trust with customers and partners. It also reduces stress on staff because drills and runbooks tell people what to do.

Teamwork shaped my soft skills. Early on, I stayed quiet because I worried I would be wrong. Later, I learned to ask simple questions. I learned to give and receive comments in a kind and direct way. This made each draft clearer and shorter. I also learned the value of consistent tone. Plain English helps readers decide. Short sentences remove doubt. Clear tables save time.

Emotionally, I moved from pressure to focus. When I felt lost, I broke tasks into small parts. I wrote one short section, then checked one source, then moved to the next. This small-steps method kept me moving. It also helped the team because I delivered pieces on time. Over the module, my confidence grew. I saw that progress is steady when the steps are simple and clear.

Technically, three skills grew the most. First, I learned to keep a live risk register with owners, actions, and review dates. Second, I learned to think in probabilities. Multiplying “no-incident” sides gave a quick view of combined chance. Third, I learned to set RTO and RPO and to plan tests. These three skills turn a plan into an operating routine. Leaders can read them and act.

## NOW WHAT
I will carry these habits into future work. I will begin each project with a short OCTAVE-style pass: list assets, threats, weak points, and quick wins. I will capture a tiny risk register in ISO 31000 style with owners and review dates. If the project is important, I will add a few simple numbers to compare options. I will always link the plan to legal needs, like GDPR Article 32, and to business goals, like uptime and order flow.

For disaster recovery, I will set targets first: how fast to switch (RTO) and how much data I can lose (RPO). I will write a small failover script and test it. I will record the results and try to improve times each test. I will keep the system simple: two regions, health checks, stateless app tier, replicated database, and least privilege. I will explain it in plain English so managers can approve it without fear.

For my personal growth, I will keep three rules. Rule one: ask early when I do not understand. It saves days later. Rule two: write simply first, then add detail where needed. It keeps a clean core. Rule three: review with a checklist. I will check sources, dates, owners, actions, and tests before I submit. These rules are small, but they cut mistakes.

I also want to learn more about risk tools. A basic dashboard with a few KPIs, owners, and due dates would help me track actions. I want to try simple sensitivity checks on probabilities. I will also explore cloud labs to practise failover. I will keep using the Rolfe model because it helps me turn events into lessons. Asking WHAT, SO WHAT, and NOW WHAT keeps me honest and forward-looking.

This module changed how I think. I now see security and risk as daily practice, not as theory. The Unit 6 artefact showed how to start small and help a real business. The Unit 11 artefact showed how to grow into a clear, tested plan with numbers and resilience. I feel ready to use these skills on real teams, serve users better, and protect trust.
